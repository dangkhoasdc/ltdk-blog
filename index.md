At the moment (May/2023):
- Playing around with [SAM](https://segment-anything.com/).
- Reading [Designing Data-Intensive Applications](https://www.goodreads.com/en/book/show/23463279). It is wayyyy overdue. I should have read this book long before.
- Reading [The Algorithm Design Manual](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/425208.The_Algorithm_Design_Manual?ref=nav_sb_ss_1_27). A fun read so far, most of the exercises can be practiced on Leetcode.
