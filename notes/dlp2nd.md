Review: Deep Learning with Python, 2nd.

This probably is one of the best resources to learn Deep Learning and its applications on images and texts.

Some chapters I like:

- Chapter 14: The best chapter of the whole book. The author gives a landscape of current progress in Deep Learning including
its current limitation, potentials, and speculative future.
- Chapter 11: I am not really familiar with text data. Therefore, it is not wrong to say this chapter really suits me. 
The intuition given by the author helps me greatly to understand the design of sequence models such as RNN, LSTM.
- Chapter 5: Although I already know some definitions described in this chapter, the explanations and examples
give me a fresh look to Deep Learning terminology.

I am a bit disappointed about the lack of expositions about Keras's API design. It makes sense because this is an introductory book, and 
it is not even a software engineer book either.
